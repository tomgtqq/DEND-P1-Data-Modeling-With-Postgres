## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

[Installing PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
```
# Installing Postgres via Brew (OSX)
brew install postgres
ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/postgresql/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
```
[Installing Psycopg2](https://www.psycopg.org/)
```
# Requires the latest pip
pip3 install -U pip
pip install pyscopg2
```


## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.They'd like a data engineer to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis. So I need to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis. 


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>


```
- test.ipynb  # Displays the first few rows of each table to let you check your database.
- etl.ipynb  #  This notebook contains detailed instructions on the ETL process for each of the tables.
- sql_queries.py # sql 
- etl.py  # Reads and processes files from song_data and log_data and loads them into the tables.
- create_tables.py # Drops and creates tables. Run this file to reset your tables before each time you run your ETL scripts.
- README.md
- data 
    |- song_data #  The dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song.
    |- log_data #   The dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above.

```

## Run <a name="results"></a>
